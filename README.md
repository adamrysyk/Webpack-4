A sandbox project used to learn Webpack 4.

To view production:

Visit https://evening-anchorage-97904.herokuapp.com.

To run this project locally:

1) npm install
2) npm install -g webpack webpack-cli nodemon
3) npm run build
4) npm run dev or npm start
5) view on localhost:7000, you may also change the port in src/server/express.js

In this project I experimented with setting up webpack with different environments.
Different environents can be found in branches apart from master.

react: react
typescript: typescript
angular: angular 7
vue: vue
ejs-pug-handlebars: ejs, pug and handlebars templating engines
css-preprocessors-sass-less-stylus: sass, less and stylus css preprocessors
